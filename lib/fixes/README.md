# Database Connection Fix

This fix helps resolve the error:

```
Error: No database connection string was provided to `neon()`. Perhaps an environment variable has not been set?
```

## Quick Solution

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

2. Import the mock database setup in your app's entry point (`app/layout.tsx` or `pages/_app.tsx`):

```tsx
// Import at the top of your file
import '@/lib/fixes/setup-mock-db';
```

## How It Works

This solution provides:

1. A mock database implementation for development
2. In-memory storage for user data, pet states, and activities
3. Automatic fallback when no database connection is available

All database operations will work normally in development without needing a real database connection, allowing you to develop and test your application locally.

## Detailed Setup 

You can choose between two approaches:

### Option 1: Use Mock Database for Development

This approach uses a mock database in development and a real database in production:

1. Keep the `.env.local` file with a dummy connection string
2. Import the mock setup in your app's entry point

### Option 2: Use a Real Database

If you want to use a real database in both environments:

1. Create a `.env.local` file with your actual Neon database credentials
2. No need to import the mock setup

## Using the Mock Database Directly

If you need to interact with the mock database directly:

```tsx
import { getMockDbService } from '@/lib/fixes/setup-mock-db';

// Get mock database service
const mockDb = getMockDbService();

// Use mock methods
await mockDb.getUserData('wallet-address');
await mockDb.updateUserData('wallet-address', { points: 100 });
await mockDb.saveUserActivity('wallet-address', { 
  id: 'activity-id',
  type: 'play',
  name: 'Played with cat',
  points: 10,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing database errors:

1. Make sure you've imported `@/lib/fixes/setup-mock-db` in your app entry point
2. Check that you've created the `.env.local` file in the project root
3. Try restarting your development server
